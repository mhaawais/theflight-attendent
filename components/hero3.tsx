            "Beginning with a haunting, nightmarish scene, <span className="font-semibold">A Place for Me</span> is rich with sensory imagery, strong emotion, and often-surprising historical detail. Sandra McKay’s depiction of Dora’s journey from a harrowing displacement to a position of strength and maturity is convincing, eventful, and deeply moving."

            Joseph L. Murphy was a highly respected attorney and an active member of the Masonic Lodge in Canton. Sandra McKay brings his character and his love for children to life. <span className="font-semibold">A Place For Me</span> is an enjoyable read, as it includes a lot of Canton’s history, including the development of the Graham Hospital, and Fulton County’s Trial of the Century. Murphy brought a little girl, Dora Kelly, home from an orphanage in Chicago. Unmothered, she became a remarkable young woman despite many setbacks and challenges.

            This is a five-part story that will appeal to people of all ages who are interested in history and the Orphan Train, and to young people seeking role models that have transitioned challenges into opportunities.

            "A Place for Me brings to life the story of an orphan train child who settled in a small Midwestern town. In an era before mass adoption and foster care, orphanages used the nation’s railway system to deliver poor children to new homes."

            Based on a true story, this fictionalized account humanizes the experiences of one such child, Dora Kelly. It is a fascinating tale: Dora is swept up by personal family drama, a sensationalized court trial, and her own search for love. Recommended for readers interested in popular history and juvenile fiction.

            During my childhood, I learned my Aunt Dora came to Canton on the Orphan Train. This was just a nugget of family history, and I never understood her amazing journey until her granddaughter Sandra brought it to life.
